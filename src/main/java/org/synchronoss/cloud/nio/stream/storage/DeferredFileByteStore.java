/**
 * <p> A {@code ByteStore} that uses a combination of memory and file to store the data.
 *    If the data is smaller than a configurable threshold the data is kept in memory, if the threshold is reached the
 *    bytes are flushed to disk.
 * <p> The {@code DeferredFileByteStore} has two distinct states:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><i>write</i>: The {@code ByteStore} is ONLY writable and NOT readable.</li>
 *     <li><i>read</i>: The {@code ByteStore} is ONLY readable and NOT writable.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p> A new instance will always start in a <i>write</i> state, ready to accept bytes and any call to the {@link #getInputStream()} will fail.
 * Once all the data has been written, the {@link #close()} method needs to be called to close the write channel and switch the
 * {@code DeferredFileByteStore} to the <i>read</i> state. At that point the data can be read via {@link #getInputStream()}.
